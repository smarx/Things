This is the source code for <http://things.smarx.com>. It's completely
unmaintained and may not even be in a working state. It installs
ASP.NET MVC 3 and Python in startup tasks, which you may not want to run
on your local machine.

The actual binaries for MVC 3 and Python (and modules) are not included.

In other words, use this code just to understand how the app works, not
necessarily to run it. :-)
